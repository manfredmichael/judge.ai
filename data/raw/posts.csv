Me and my boyfriend broke up last night because for the past couple of weekends we only speak if I call him. He spent three weeks not working and his excuse was he was spending time with his cousin and trying to get his life together. 
I told him that’s fine but a text here and there or a call would be nice. He said his schedule doesn’t work like that. 

I asked him to spend time together on Fourth of July a week ago. He told me yesterday no he wants to work. 

I told him we haven’t seen each other by ourselves in almost three weeks. He said spending time with his cousin is draining. 

Honestly I’m tired of being put in the back burner. When I call him his answers are flat like I’m boring him. We never see each other anymore and on our anniversary he didn’t say anything to me. When I text he doesn’t respond when I call he quickly hangs up.  
It’s very exhausting feeling like you are a burden to your partner. Anyways when I brought up my grievances to him he immediately when on a tirade of how he’s trying to destress and organize his life which I said was fine but a couple minutes here and there isn’t too much to ask for… make me a priority you know? 

He basically told me to go pound sand and we broke up he told me to come get my shit from his house and I did.
